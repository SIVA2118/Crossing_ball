# Ball Animation Web Project

This project demonstrates simple ball animation using JavaScript to move two balls (`ball1` and `ball2`) within the browser viewport. The two balls move diagonally with bouncing behavior, changing direction when they reach the edges of the viewport.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure, inline CSS, and JavaScript code for animating two balls.
  
## Features

- Two blue balls with circular shapes (`ball1` and `ball2`), styled using inline CSS.
- Balls move within the viewport diagonally and change direction (bounce) when hitting the boundaries.
- Movement is controlled by JavaScript using the `setInterval` method to update the position.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

3. Observe the balls moving diagonally within the viewport.

## How it Works

- The balls are positioned absolutely with CSS, and JavaScript updates their `left`, `right`, and `top` properties to animate the movement.
- When a ball reaches a boundary (top or left/right edges), its direction is reversed, simulating a bounce effect.

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex animations, such as varying speeds or interactive controls.
- Add support for mobile responsiveness.
